Tens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states. As a separate matter, hundreds of thousands of Votes were illegally not allowed to be OBSERVED...

I had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by. Perhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!
Joe Biden should not wrongfully claim the office of the President. I could make that claim also. Legal proceedings are just now beginning!
Where are the missing military ballots in Georgia? What happened to them?
With the attack by the Radical Left Dems on the Republican Senate, the Presidency becomes even more important!
....hopefully this will be corrected at the Supreme Court of the United States. Also, these late ballots past Election Day are illegal, exactly what the President has been saying. The Supreme Court, in extraordinary circumstances,...
....has been able to render decisions in a matter of days.‚Äù Ken Starr, former Independent Counsel @Varneyco
....Legislature. They just ignored that, ignored the Constitution. Now we bring it down to the counting houses, and outrageously, observers, who are the sentinels of integrity &amp; transparency, were excluded. Pennsylvania has conducted itself in a horrible lawless way, and....
‚ÄúThis is what we know. We have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance. The Governor, Wolf, and the State Supreme Court, flagrantly violated the Constitution of the U.S. The power to set these rules and regulations is vested in the
‚ÄúPhiladelpiha has got a rotten history on election integrity.‚Äù @Varneyco @FoxBusiness
Twitter is out of control, made possible through the government gift of Section 230!
I easily WIN the Presidency of the United States with LEGAL VOTES CAST. The OBSERVERS were not allowed, in any way, shape, or form, to do their job and therefore, votes accepted during this period must be determined to be ILLEGAL VOTES. U.S. Supreme Court should decide!
So now the Democrats are working to gain control of the U.S. Senate through their actions on John James, David Perdue, and more. Would End the Filibuster, ‚ÄúLife‚Äù, 2A, and would Pack and Rotate the Court. Presidency becomes even more important. We will win!

Your 401k‚Äôs will crash with Biden. Massive Biden Tax and Regulation increases will destroy all that you have built! Additionally, 180 Million People will lose their Private Healthcare Plans.
Remember, BIDEN is going to raise your taxes at a level never seen before. This will not only be very costly for you, it will destroy our economy, which is coming back very rapidly.

Governor Cuomo has shown tremendously poor leadership skills in running N.Y. Bad time for him to be writing and promoting a book, especially since he has done such a poor job with Covid and Crime. So many unnecessary deaths. The City &amp; State have sunk to historic lows...
....Washington wants nothing to do with him, and that‚Äôs so bad for New York, which has become a ghost town. Andrew spends too much time listening to his brother, Fredo. Forget the books and your apology tour. The Federal Government would love to help New York regain its luster!
...P.S. Tony should stop wearing the Washington Nationals‚Äô Mask for two reasons. Number one, it is not up to the high standards that he should be exposing. Number two, it keeps reminding me that Tony threw out perhaps the worst first pitch in the history of Baseball!
Dr.Tony Fauci says we don‚Äôt allow him to do television, and yet I saw him last night on @60Minutes, and he seems to get more airtime than anybody since the late, great, Bob Hope. All I ask of Tony is that he make better decisions. He said ‚Äúno masks &amp; let China in‚Äù. Also, Bad arm!
GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families. Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list. At long last, JUSTICE for the American people and BIG step for Sudan!

Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop is a disaster for the entire Biden family, but especially for his father, Joe. It is now a proven fact, and cannot be denied, that all of that info is the REAL DEAL. That makes it impossible for ‚Äú50%, or 10%‚Äù Joe, to ever assume the office of the President!

If we don‚Äôt win, the Radical Left will destroy our Country. Biden refuses to answer questions on packing the SCOTUS! Dems will pack the Court w/ radical left justices who will shred the #2A, empower violent mobs, and protect terrorists &amp; violent criminals! https://t.co/qUrjRM6MTp

On top of a lie made up by a low-life ‚Äúreporter‚Äù, who is known for disinformation, the Democrats have taken his false words and put them into a TV commercial. We now have 21 witnesses stating that the story is a BIG LIE. Even Biden admits this may not be true...

Nancy Pelosi says she got ‚Äúset up‚Äù by a Beauty Parlor owner. Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy?
Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was ‚Äúset up‚Äù by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn‚Äôt wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP?
Do you notice that any time Fake News Suppression Polls are put out, like @FoxNews, the Stock Market goes DOWN. We are going to WIN!

Based on the massive number of Unsolicited &amp; Solicited Ballots that will be sent to potential Voters for the upcoming 2020 Election, &amp; in order for you to MAKE SURE YOUR VOTE COUNTS &amp; IS COUNTED, SIGN &amp; MAIL IN your Ballot as EARLY as possible. On Election Day, or Early Voting,..
.....go to your Polling Place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been Tabulated (Counted). If it has you will not be able to Vote &amp; the Mail In System worked properly. If it has not been Counted, VOTE (which is a citizen‚Äôs right to do). If your Mail In Ballot arrives....
....after you Vote, which it should not, that Ballot will not be used or counted in that your vote has already been cast &amp; tabulated. YOU ARE NOW ASSURED THAT YOUR PRECIOUS VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED, it hasn‚Äôt been ‚Äúlost, thrown out, or in any way destroyed‚Äù. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
.@NYGovCuomo should get his puppet New York prosecutors, who have been illegally after me and my family for years, to investigate his incompetent handling of the China Virus, and all of the deaths caused by this incompetence. It is at minimum a Nursing Home Scandal - 11,000 DEAD!
Sleepy Joe Hiden‚Äô was acknowledged by his own people to have done a terrible job on a much easier situation, H1N1 Swine Flu. The OBiden Administration failed badly on this, &amp; now he sits back in his basement and criticizes every move we make on the China Virus. DOING GREAT JOB! https://t.co/p2H40mD7Sh
Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York has the worst record on death and China Virus. 11,000 people alone died in Nursing Homes because of his incompetence!

When a Kennedy loses a Democrat Primary in Massachusetts, by a lot, it just shows how far LEFT that party has gone. Joe Hiden‚Äô will never be able to hold them back. Life, 2nd A, Energy, Religion, Jobs and the Economy, would be totally obliterated!
Will soon be heading to Wilmington, North Carolina, and then will be going to Battleship North Carolina. Look forward to seeing all of my friends!
2016 was AMAZING, but we never had this kind of ENTHUSIASM!
We had FAR more people (many millions) watching us at the RNC than did Sleepy Joe and the DNC, and yet an ad just ran saying the opposite. This is what we‚Äôre up against. Lies. But we will WIN!
The Beauty Parlor owner must really dislike Crazy Nancy Pelosi. Turning her in, on tape, is a really big deal. She probably treats him like she treats everyone else...And she strongly supported a Kennedy who just lost in, of all places, Massachusetts!
Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individual, especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He‚Äôs back in his basement now - no schedule!
