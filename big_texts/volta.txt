Neonecropopulace has no reflection
Neocaeczaristic phallic ruins
Just east of the river denial the techs are breathing
Welcome to this neotokyo
Gridlocks will warn the chromlech alarms
Bouquet of cuticles
Landscape tantrums
Tramontane torching the tramontane
I've heard the mumbling of citadels shifting on this richter scale
The alleys will flow marble intercourse
Roil the pantheon... of subterfuge
Tramontane torching the tramontane
This marabout isn't untouchable
Indentured by servitude
Neoinfidels - let's plug them in
Neopolygraphic, trip chords
Centrocircuiphobia the fallacy
Welcome to neotokyo
Tore the wings off seraphin, fed them to the anglophiles
In this stag caberat the bark of buildings surged, through the whipping volt abode
Go to the lexicon you sluggard, if you will.
In denial
Who will come clean all the ravenous debris
In disguise
Sideswiped by penance cerecloth sentencing

This scapegrace will pay my barking harangue... are you listening?

On the 14th you stole
What hasn't grown old

In denial
File this under a bridge that he can't leave

Will those shadows glare
From that blank-rimmed stare
In a vacancy hush

Aunque me dejastes ahogado en el mar, acuestate en la tierra de la realidad de tu sueno,
Manos me recuerdo solamente a ti te odio yo ya me voy

In denial
Who will clean up all this ravenous debris
In denial
File this under a bridge that he can't leave

And the storyville
Sawbones couldn't tell
The prescription to mend
All the broken wills
In the white lie wards
Don't you pretend

Tangled in thorns
To walk unborn

And this debt will collect
All the sickness that infects

Suddenly drives up
Sentencing valley
Count all the handshakes
Syringe overflows

Tangled in thorns
To walk unborn

And this debt will collect
All the sickness that you infect
And this debt will collect
All the sickness you infect

And this debt
The al sirat hides behind a wardrobe of eunuchs
Seconds collide till the padisha scandal
The cauldrons have eyes by way of racket and vice
A brothel's bedpan filled with demimonde lice
Dethroned by the comatorium
De-loused in the comatorium
The al sirat hides behind a wardrobe of eunuchs
Seconds collide till the padisha scandal
Tribunals installed now that the provoste has been de-frocked
The labefaction is venal
My how these tricks turn themselves
In the wake of the inquisition limbless answers inoculated
I've caught mono bobbing for barbed wire
These nasty sores of ataxia will feel the sting of the opiate copulation
Clipside of the pinkeye flight
I'm not the percent you think survives
I need sanctuary in the pages of this book
Gestating with all the other rats
Nurse said that my skin will need a graft
I am of pockmarked shapes
The vermin you need to loathe
Now I'm lost

Last night I heard lepers
flinch like birth defects
its musk was fecal in origin
as the words dribbled off of its chin
it said I'm lost
I'm lost

Now I'm lost

Dolls wreck the minced meat of pupils
cast in oblong arms length
the hooks have been picking their scabs
where wolves hide in the company of men
it said I'm lost
I'm lost

Now I'm lost

Are you peaking in the red
perforated at the neck

What of this mongrel architect
a broken arm of sewers set
past present and future tense
clipside of the pinkeye fountain

Now I'm lost

It's been said
long time ago
you'll be the first and last to know

You'll never know
Transient jet lag ecto mimed bison
This is the haunt of roulette dares
Ruse of metacarpi
Caveat emptor....to all that enter here
Open wrists talk back again
In the wounded of its skin
They'll pinprick the witness
In ritual contrition
The am trinity fell upon asphyxia-derailed
In the rattles of...
Made its way through the tracks
Of a snail slouching whisper
A half mass comute through umbilical blisters
Spector will lurk
Radar has gathered
Midnight nooses from boxcar cadavers
Exoskeletal junction at the railroad delayed

Bayonet trials rust propellers await

Afloat with engines on mute
Sui generis ship spined around the yard

At the nape of ruins rust propellers await

Just as he hit
The ground
They lowered a tow that
Stuck in his neck to the gills
Fragments of sobriquets
riddle me this
three half eaten corneas
who hit the aureole
Stalk the ground
Stalk the ground
You should have seen
The curse that flew right by you
Page of concrete
Stained walks crutch in hobbled sway
Auto-da-fe
A capillary hint of red
Only this manupod
Crescent in shape has escaped
The house half the way
Fell empty with teeth
That split both his lips
Mark these words
One day this chalk outline will circle this city
Was he robbed of the asphalt that cushioned his face
A room colored charlatan
Hid in a safe
Stalk the ground
Stalk the ground
You should have seen
The curse that flew right by you
Page of concrete

Pull the pins
Save your grace
Mark these words

You should have seen
The curse that flew right by you
Page of concrete
Stain walks crutch in hobbled sway
Auto-da-fe
A capillary hint of red
Everyone knows the last toes are
Always the coldest to go
You must have been phlegmatic in stature
The gates of thanos are a spread eagle wide
You let the shutters make sackcloth and ashes
Out of a blind mans picaresque heart

You take the veil
You'll take the dive
You take the veil

It's not over till the tremulant sings
These ides of march
Are they so make believe
How tempts the revenant
Slice up and not across

You take the veil
You'll take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth
As flys have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim-someone said but who is to know
And when you find the fringe
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary spilling by the day

The iconoclastic had it coming for years
They know the prisons that you have yet to fear
Where thumbs hide inside of sleepingbag mouths
Adlib your memoires by casting a drought

You take the veil
You'll take the dive
You take the veil

A mass of gallon sloth
As flys have walls for feet
A rapturous verbatim-someone said but who is to know
And when you find the fringe
The one last hit that spent you
You'll find the ossuary spilling by the day

Knife me in -hobbeling
Talking in it's sleep again
Knife me in-hobbeling
Talking in it's sleep again

Knife me in hobbling
Talking in it's sleep again
Knife me in hobbling
Talking in It's sleep again

Virulent hives- of bedpost piles
Virulent hives

Who brought me here
Forsaken, depraved and wrought with fear
Who turned it off
The last thing I remember now
Who brought me here
Forsaken, depraved and wrought with fear

Oh lord,
Oh lord, You've made it....

You wanna drag your vessel
you wanna hush your voices

you better drag your... you better hush your...

I'll remember that I'll need to carry on
I'll pretend you're not around, I'll forget you
just like everyone else, I'll forget you
is there anybody around, I'll forget you
just like anyone
just because, just because, just because
do you come here ohhh
shiver around, shiver around

oh lord, oh lord, you've made it....

You wanna drag your vessel
You wanna hush your voices

...hush your mouth
The ocean floor is hidden
From your viewing lens
A depth perception
Languished in the night
All my life,I've been
Sowing the wounds
But the seeds sprout
A lachrymal cloud

Nino preparate
Que vas sufrir

Salte veneno

My nails peel back
When the taxidermist ruined
Goose stepped the freckling impatience
All the brittle tombs
Five hundred little q's
I'm splitting hairs to
Match the faces

All night I'll hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre
Sonando
De rabia naci

Now this train don't lie
An abortion that survived
A lineage of
Bastard mastacation
All the severed proof
Talons scratch my suite
These are the feathers
That replace them

All night I'll hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre
Sonando
De rabia naci

Who do you trust
Will they feed us the womb
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb
I found the remnants
Of a crescent fang
It cleaned my wing
Down to the bone
Umbilical syllables
Left to decode
There was no cradle
I can taste it
Come on now

All night I'll hunt for you
Let me show you what I mean
Sangre
Sonando
De rabia naci

Who do you trust
Will they feed us the womb
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb
Bring me this plague
She took a drink
Those nicotine stains
On his every word
My scavenger quilt
Will only hide the truth
Bring me
Bring me this plague
I count the days to find
What was left behind
Only these names I clutch
Will lead me to my home
Somehow this river marks
A wrinkle hand in mine
And everyday that parts
The water into two
Mothers and feathers start
To drown the living proof
I can't remember these lakes of blood
Wrapped in a blanket
There sweats a cut
Who do you trust
Will they feed us the womb
Chrome the fetal mirage
Will they feed us the womb
He's got fasting black lungs
Made of clove splintered shardes
They're the kind that will talk
Through a weezing of coughs

And I hear him every night
In every pore
And every time he just makes me warm

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Must I hide?
Cause I'll never
Never sleep alone

Look at how they flock to him
From an isle of open sores
He knows that the taste is such
Such to die for

And I hear him every night
On every street
The scales that do slither
Deliver me from...

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide
Cause I'll never
Never sleep alone

Oh lord
Said I'm bloodshot for sure
Pale runs the ghost
Swollen on the shore

Everynight
in every pore
The scales that do slither
Deliver me from...

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Then I'll hide
Cause I'll never
Never sleep alone

Freeze without an answer
Free from all the shame
Let me die
Cause I'll never
Never sleep alone

Y yo te lo juro
Lo van a pagar
Blackmailed, she fell off every mountain
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape
In her eraser sang the guilty
As it made the best mistakes
And with every body that I find
And with every claymore that they mine
I won't forget who I'm looking for
Oh mother help me I'm looking for

Solo tengo
Una hora
Y me duermo
Terminado
Por veinte y cinco
Anos pasaron
Siguen los cuerpos
Aqui temblando
Tome la sangre
Comi el cuerpo
Mis lagrimas
Quiebra el espejo

When all the worms come
Crawlin out of your head
Telling you
Don't you be afraid
When all the worms come
Crawlin out of your head
Telling you
Don't you be afraid

Blackmailed she fell off every mountain
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape
In her eraser sang the guilty
As it made the best mistakes
Shark kites got tangled in the moleskin
Urgent plea of escape
A mouth to mouth on the chalkboard
Written in fingernail distaste
And with every body that I find
And with every claymore that they mine
I won't forget who I'm looking for
Oh mother help me I'm looking for

Blackmailed she fell off every mountain
The ones they tightly wrapped in tape
In her eraser sang the guilty
As it made the best mistakes
And with every body that I find
And with every claymore that they mine
I won't forget who I'm looking for
Oh mother help me I'm looking for
I've always wanted
To eat glass with you again
But I never knew how
How to talk without
Walls dropping on the eve
The nest they made couldn't break you
Along the fallen
Scowled a fence of beaks
But the temple is scathing
Through your veins
They were scaling
Through an ice pick of abscess reckoning

And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey

And whoever said that they would scatter
Separating the mother from child
She can bat a broken eyelid
Raining maggots from its sty
And with the traces that she leaves
She will skin you out alive

All the children go grinding their jaws
The sweet smell of their toothless canals
And the dam she will break,
Make an ocean from this lake
As they siphon off all our blood

And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey

And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey

And when Miranda sang
Everyone turned away
Used to the noose they obey

There was a frail syrup dripping off
His lap danced lapel, punctuated by her
Decrepit prowl she washed down the hatching
Gizzard soft as a mane of needles
His orifice icicles hemorrhaged
By combing her torso to a pile
Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse
She was a mink hand job in sarcophagus heels

Bring me to my knees
Read the sharpened lines
All my arms,
Bled me blind
Faucet leaks in shadows
Spilling from morgue lancet
Caressed your fontanelle
I've sworn to kill every last one
Every last one
Panic in the shakes of the wounded
Panic in the worms
Onto the floor
And out of your mouth
Out of your eyelids

No there's no light, in the darkest
Of your furthest reaches
No there's no light, in the darkest
Of your furthest reaches

All your dreams, splintered off
Leech by leech on this catafalque
Anyone will tell you, yes anyone
Chance had me setting a trip wire alarm
Your mother flirted with disease
When she skinned that costume by its navel strings
Panic in the shakes of the wounded
Panic in the worms, onto the floor
And out of your mouth
And out of your eyelids

No there's no light, in the darkest
Of your furthest reaches
No there's no light, in the darkest
Of your furthest reaches
No there's no light, in the darkest
Of your furthest reaches

Shock lest shackles free you
Volt face cons
abandon you again
I won't feel not this time

Shock lest shackles free you
Volt face cons

[c. PISACIS (PHRA-MEN-MA)]

Brick by brick, the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep on nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more,
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become

If you should see the dice,
Charmed with its snaked choked eyes
You'll wear the widows weeds
Because they're just your size
Behind the snail secretion,
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs
A limbless procreation,
Let the infant crawled deformed
A bag replaced the breath of these suffocating sheets
And now when the craving calls
I'll scratch my itchy teeth

Come on and sing it now...

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight,
Night forever more
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight,
Night forever more

She fell for the whispers,
Sister flooded deaf tears
That night tore a river,
In her baron womb mirror
And his multiple sons with their mandible tongues
Set crucified fires to petrified homes...
Let it burn

And the owls they were watching
And the owls didn't care
Then the owls came a knocking,
Placenta in their stares
They will feed on all the carnage,
Leftover from the flood
And in the corner of their eyes,
Fled sister L' Via
Sister L' Via

Now the pieces went floating,
Reflecting all at dusk
Conceived from the stabbing,
was Vismund Cygnus

Twenty five wives in the lake tonight...

Twenty five wives in the lake tonight
Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
Twenty five snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah the icepicks cumming on the marble shrine
Twenty five snakes are drowning

I think I've become one of the others, oh, oh, oh
Think I've become one of the others, oh, oh, oh
I think I've become... one of the others, oh, oh, yeah yeah

There was a frail syrup dripping off his lap danced lapel
Punctuated by her decrepit prowl she

Perspired the trophy shelves made room for his collapse

In the darkest of your furthest reaches

Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time
Shockless shackles free you
Volt face cons
Abandon you again
I won't feel, not this time, oh, yeah!

Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep of nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste
Oh, oh, oh

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become

If you should see the dice
Charmed with its snaked choked eyes
You'll wear the widows weeds
Because they're just your size

Behind the snail secretion
Leaves a dry heave that absorbs
A limbless procreation
Let the infant crawl deformed
A bag replace the breath
Of these suffocating sheets
And now when the craving calls
I'll scratch my itchy sheath

And soon
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know
Come on
If you don't know

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more

She fell for the whispers
Sister flooded deaf tears
That night tore a river
In her barren womb mirror
And his multiple sons
With their mandible tongues
Set crucified fires to petrified homes
L-L-L-L-L-L-L-Let it burn
I want, I want, I want, I want to let it burn

And the owls they were watching
And the owls didn't care
Then the owls came a' knocking
Placenta in their stares
They will feed on all the carnage
Leftover from the flood
And in the corner of their eyes
Fled sister L'Via
Sister L'Via

Now the pieces went floating
Reflecting all at dusk
Conceived from the stabbing
Was Vismund Cygnus

Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine

Raw bark in the water of the marble shrine
25 snakes pour out your eyes
Yeah, the ice picks cumming, cumming tonight

Woah, woah

You can't bend your crooked arms
Or fold your punctured proof
The air is growing cold, cold, cold, cold, cold
And there's nothing you can do
Soon there'll be no gauze
Inside the confessional
Only rows of crows
Defrocking every breath, breath, breath, breath

One day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
I said one day you'll remember
Behind the melting cones
You've always had a family
In the burial of your home
In the burial of your home
Burial of your home
Burial of your home, ffffph

Night forevermore
Night forevermore
Night forevermore
Night forevermore
Night forevermore
And I peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin
Peel it back let it all run
Peel back all of my skin

Brick by brick the night eclipsed
Pricked by cuticle thorns
Dried the sleep on nursery slits
Into this life I'm born
Heaven's just a scab away
I'd like to see you after just one taste

Sink your teeth into the flesh of midnight
Night forever more
Let them see it has begun
The others I've become

No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light
In the darkest of your furthest reaches
No there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)
In the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, your life was just a lie)
No there's no light (No there's no light, no there's no time)
In the darkest of your furthest reaches (You ain't got nothing, you ain't got-)

The ocean floor is hidden from your viewing lens
A depth perception languished in the night
All my life, I've been sewing the wounds
But the seeds sprout a lachrymal cloud
Ooooh...

It’s been thirteen seconds
Since you all last said
I’ve become the apparition
You predicted for my death
You said that flirting brings you
Closer to the end
You can bathe into the water
But you’ll never get the hint
And like a stain of bricks goes
Dancing by your head
Plucked from an icebox
Grafted on my skin
[repeat]

My coat has hid the marks
Mink hits the shovel fix
Near the sway of pendulums
Boar abrasions and a kiss
She said, "I’ll never let them hurt you
I’ll never let them in
What you took from me is mine
And what is mine I’ll never give"

[Nineteen Sank, While Six Could Swim]

Mascara glass in the molar weeds
Her ash, a serpent infancy
His eye patch pussed a gap of sand
Into his shiny sedative
More and more the dirt collects
You’ll never find her body now
In a closet festered in a secret air
Blonde underneath a blackened hair
He never knew the colony
Gestated in his bed
Mingle with the carnivores, you’ve something both in common now
Until one day his wasted breath,
Swollen throat and karma debt
Set foot inside a parlor, to find her drunken by receipts
He held her by the ankle
Gutted at the nave, yes gutted and depraved
He tied a rope around her legs
And let her hang for seven days

[Five Would Grow And One Was Dead]

This never happened, but I saw you leave
And crawl into a bed of broken windows
Don't you pretend
That I'm not alive
My bones never ache
Unless she's nearby
Where is your face
In a safe of dead tongues
I can see your reflection
In your totem first born
I suspect
You've been carrying a pack of wolves
I regret
Not killing you while I had the chance

Maybe I will always haunt you
Mark the somnolence with truth
Better hang your dead palace
Than have a living home to lose
In the river ganges God damns my name

Don't let these hands
Sharpen your eyes
A rasp of tails

Tell me it's over, Rusbel awaits I've been to the surface
And nothing is there, Eyelids sank muffled
In the nerve aura sound, But when she awakes
Will she still be with us?

My heart is darkclots, Leap year is late
How did you get here, Ask all but the bail
From a Christ that went hissing
Constricting his cells
We summon by candle by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside God
Mirrors to the animals

The sermon goes mourning, Pricking it's hail
Slothful the child, That preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought, Wound under sleeves
I hope you have room, In a thicket of vines

Give me a moment, To clean what you've stole
The streets will hang high, Stretch ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate
Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside God
Mirrors to the animals

Then so long, Dear minemonic
Assume the form, You've given me and I'll spill

Now hold on, Just hold my hand
Say that they made you
But you brought your own leash
Tell me no more no, say I'm the last one
Outside, By the drift, You read my will
Of thread and itch, Failure to comply
As failure to decease
And still you won't know everything
I've built the fall

Sulking drained the fall of my pale will
Swarming by your steps
Licking the ankles of blasphemer guilts
It only meant to drape a plastic
Over the stuck pig scalp of head
To cover the sock where to flatline had spread
The kiosk in my temporal lobe
Is shaped like Rasalyn Carter
She says my map is home again, But torn face down
I have only but a million blemishes
To tell you all about

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

Gas me the hind, Of your five legged snare
Tooth picks the eye, But no things there
Down drags your waltz, Cross the alter top
From a sleep that, Depravation knew
Trespass your form, I'm void of dusk
I'd ask to look, But the mask stays on

You'll levitate, Teutonic print
Cruelty is the wrath, Of my instrument

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

You locked the cuffs
Arsenic erupts

Will you drink the shadow
Of my red hair

You and your falst, Witness to God
You've one in the chamber,
But your finger got stuck

Let slip the sound, Of a cry for help
But all was lost, On the night you walked

Palms speak through eyes
Serve your memory lost
I cantaminate with insignias

In the end they just gagged me
To make him come out

Glassolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence
Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

Wait till I get my hands on you
I won't forget a face that left me
Just you wait
Till I get my hands on you
I can't, You won't remember

Unwrap my corpse, And let it thaw
In the eye of the needle, I can't get out

They'll check my wrist, I'll faint a pulse
I'm not the human, You thought I was

If you pet the night, Sixth pentacle dice
If you roll the seven, St. Michael dies

They'll be no ransom, Don't shut my mouth
I scaled the answer, You're afraid of

There with them is error
We are sacrosanct
A taunting of ravens to you
My swarms have fit the holster
My faith burnt every house
Like no other manger
I am emptier with doubt

Bare them
Sevens
Three to a pall
Marks the
Venom
Lush and terminal

When I became your larvae
You fed me from your plates
Now my slouch is nervous
Sinking by the face
Wrinkled by this gravel
Skinless trace of time
Wear your cobwebs proudly
In your cheap and brittle sight
My glands emit this carnage
These pews bend back your knees

That uniform it wears you
When the ultimatum pleads

Bare them
Sevens
Three to a pall
Marks the
Venom
Lush and terminal

That cesspool it becomes you
Just north of the eyebrows
Squat the hole for a pucker
When the rations go blonde
The salted stitch is patient
Waiting to engulf
There is plasma from this hoax
Pretending to be us

Embalming all the fluids I must I must
I prefer to burn it I must I must

Amputechture came
Philistine praise
Bottomless pit of empty names
Incarcerated habits pour from the palms
Severing the breast
Nursing all the young

They needed those locks
Of dirty red hair
A necklace of follicles with sabertooth monocles
They want a bouquet of black rose gems
Castrating kisses stalactite stems
They went and built a capsule in the cyanide pond
Where the holiest of water would have you to drown

Tomorrow we forget
'cause now has never left
You gotta find my body
In the mechacontext

You give me a corpse
You live in it now
You stir from a camp nourishment plows

Please dismantle all these phantom limbs
It's the evidence of humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments

Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury me

This dirt
Is turning Christ to make repent again
So I've heard
They're cutting all the youngest ones
Said this dirt
Is turning Christ to make repent his lust
So I've heard
That the puppet tugs its pull

Please dismantle all these phantom limbs
It's the evidence of humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments

Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury me

Nova meat
The prude slit whisper of bovine heaps
Strapped to unearth of mantis flowers
Prune fingers who tug in a zealot's shroud

I will scald supreme truth
As it touches this house
I will scald supreme truth

Please dismantle all these phantom limbs
It's the evidence of humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments
Humans as ornaments

Scald supreme truth as it touches this house
Scald supreme truth as it touches this house

Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury me

Everyone stabs all the time
Persuasion deflowers your sympathy
Everybody has chosen to help
The shovels that bury me

It lacks a human pulse

Enfermo llegue
Y para componerme ando de vago
No me des tu obediencia
Por que te enseno mi cuerpo de lodo
En donde la piel estuvo debil
Con una hambre que no me deja cantar

En mi vida,
El oscuro me mantiene
Cuando yo te vi
En la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre

Yo no me quedo en mi vida
El oscuro me mantiene
Cuando yo te vi
En la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre
Yo no me quedo

Y ya que caiste de este mundo
Cargo una navaja
Dios mio
Para ti
Cuantas veces me mordiste
Y cuantas veces yo me fui

Y ya no me estoy enamorado
Con tus mentiras
El infierno me duermo
Por que el infierno es la unica verdad

En mi vida,
El oscuro me mantiene
Cuando yo te vi
En la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre

Yo no me quedo en mi vida
El oscuro me mantine
Cuando yo te vi
En la lluvia me prometistes tu sangre
Yo no me quedo

Estrella de la manana
Samael te persigo a ti
Y si me quedo sin alas
Ademas me muero por ti

Estrella de la manana
Samael te persigo a ti
Y si me quedo sin alas
Ademas me muero por ti

Estrella de la manana
Samael te persigo a ti
Y si me quedo sin alas
Ademas me muero por ti

Estrella de la manana
Samael te persigo a ti
Y si me quedo sin alas
Ademas me muero por ti

Estrella de la manana
Samael te persigo a ti
Y si me quedo sin alas
Ademas me muero por ti

Por quando te vi enfermo con mentiras
Este ladron cuenta se dio
Trapa mal hecho de trampas te lo juro
Que yo si te mato
Y con cada dia que se pase requerdate
Quien era el mas poderoso

Don't let me, don't let me go
There is a venom in numerical lies
Your convalescent thorns
Are but a crown of magnets
They fold the shakes inside that third glass eye
Come on and give it to me
Come on and die

In your viscera eyes
Cateracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort come drown by your side

Hay mi hija no me llores
Porque yo te quito de esta cruz
A noche te vi caminando sin la alma de tu cuerpo
En los brasos sin luz

Stains fall into the brick wall severed
Four of them were watching
While the other three did hide
The culprit spat the seed from a podium of glass
Shattering the sigil that you thought was deitized

Don't let me, don't let me go
There is a venom in numerical lies
Your convalescent thorns
Are but a crown of maggots
They rot the shakes inside that third glass eye
Come on and give it to me
Come on and die

In your viscera eyes
Cateracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort come drown by your side

In your viscera eyes
Cateracts close the blinds
Let me let comfort come drown by your side

Wait
I've seen the arc shake from your mnemonic tongue
But the braille that you weave of itself, it shall read aloud
Yes it will
I said, she's falling, she's still falling
But no one wants to come
She's crawling, she's still crawling
On your burial ground
She's falling, she's still falling
But no one wants to come
I said, she's crawling, she's still crawling
On your burial ground

Sawing off the pavement
Repenting their past lives
Might I be the only payment left
To be left behind
Clay and pigment footsteps
Rust it boiling clean
Our bull let in linguistics
That only we can breathe

I gotta prayer that'll make you theirs now
Beneath sepulchers
Raise your entrails as an offer

Fondling with pitchforks
In a cattle prodded sea
Signaling the sedatives
To emaciate their queen
Bowing in constriction
Anytime you leave
We snuffed ourselves an angel
And cut her by the wings

I gotta prayer that'll make you theirs now
Beneath sepulchers
Raise your entrails as an offer

In my sight I was born
To bring death at the footsteps of your home
Tonight
I have sewn
All the hair and crooked nails
That you all have worn
While your wife
Sits at home
I plant the vermin
Because she needs it so

How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
Our centipedes will get theirs yet

Poachers in your home
Poachers in your home

How long must we fold by hand
The nuns are burning wheels again
Dent of mattress to make it bare
Come clean with the anecdote
After all we came undone
Pale of sluts with host at fault
One day we won't pay your debt
Our centipedes will get theirs yet

Fold the river by the lips
As a cruel and smothered wind
Fits the gash with ornaments
Dawn is nodding off again
Raised the braille to read it clear
Gathered by the cholera
Rinse the burns in cauldrons
Help the palm we see a lens
My hands secrete a monument
My hands secrete a monument

I am the reason
Four your missing child
They might be home
But there's no trace
Under your pillow
I have left a spine
Oh the things we do
When you're away
I saw the message
That you wrote in the sand
Dismembered hints that carve away
The anesthetic of your gospel said
Put a muzzle on the lamb

Give me one page
Give me one page
Make it blank
Mace that I leak
Will rain
Give me one page
Give me one page
Make it blank
Race I inflict
Your way

Maybe one day you'll stop and realize
The throne that you serve is dead

Give me a plague
Give me a plague
Make it blank
Nothing you own is safe

I've been drinking black mirror again
The closer we part
I needed to touch your lips
With the nail in my heart
The night that you caught me
My coffin did walk
I fell at your mercy
I fell in your grave
Meccamputechture
That stands in my way
The younger I stay
An elderly child
The longer the mirror gives birth
To the death I file

If you consume me I will not let you go
If you walk right through me
My voice will taint your throat
Blessed be the wrong I've done

Someone is watching us
Someone has found
Fluorescent ligaments
On a black white tile
Why do you call them
If your kingdom won't come
The younger I stay
Forever I rot

If you consume me I will not let you go
If you walk right through me
My voice will taint your throat
Blessed be the wrong I've done

Because the flies my mouth spill
Bare the children at play

Have you seen the living
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

Am I the one you're after
The novice made to find
Stray abhoration stalking
Plans that forgot me 99 times
The only thing to alter
Stands in the way of you
I want your cramps to fit
The fillings of my teeth

Have you seen the living?
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

And don't you try and ask me
Your expiration date
The plans that forgot me 99 times
You'll be the one who opens the gate
Carry water in a basket
Where the hole was dug the first time
The head that carries the body
A blood that flows through veins

Have you seen the living?
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

When it calls I'll answer
Do you need to repent?
The plans that forgot me 99 times
I'll stick around for 99 times
The fault lines you prepare have darkened
Blank rings instead of sight
Goliath, are you receiving?
Dismembered, you've arrived

Have you seen the living?
Tired of their own shells
All the non-believers
Torso in the well

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch

This is a list
They're my demands
Forget the question
Come on bring your nervous hands
You read it in my letter
"Patience worth is dead"
Suffocate the inkwell
"I am legion" said the pen
Her seraph snout
And cruciform limp
I blame the shrouding of a lesser man
My sigil contraptions
They walk with no crutches
Don't show me the hinges
I am absent

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch

She came to me
When she was pouring out of drool
Under sedation
Under vulgar multitudes
If you stay and try
To fix what you did
The sheets were wet from all those messages
A million petitions
Her lock with no key
You forfeit the right to be believed
Full implant
Shapeless as a jewel
And I am stranded by eternal solitude

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch

The vault that I call home
It falls beneath your palms
Before I crawl my way out
She calls
When you're standing right outside my window
Water thirsting
You're standing right outside my window
Water thirsting
When will I drown?

I'll never get a distant shot
Heard vessper pure
I never want to see your face
Until the word is made flesh
You'd better ask Metatron
Those flowers that withered away
In the pages of your book
For one day they won't block your route

In the dead plot you dream in
Ten go away
Ten born of pray
Ten go away

Folding wormholes
My time is riding in the alphabet
Folding wormholes
My time is writing on the wall

In the dead plot you dream in
Ten go away
Ten born of pray
Ten go away

Folding wormholes
My time is riding in the alphabet
Folding wormholes
My time is writing on the wall

Debase by your sentence
I fell in the trap
What door slid behind me?
I can't see it anymore
When she sleeps as a witness
Got no better hands
Tied a single stutter
Do you speak my dialect?
Accidents will happen
Keep your earnings to yourself
One sip under the table
Until it moves all by itself
In the eye of fatima
I've kept all your dreams
In a waking solution of indictment

Maybe I'll break down
Maybe I'll try
Circumvent inoculation
And I just want a cut
When will I break down?
Lately I might
Un-connect the fascination
And I just want to touch

When the chants have cycled
How can I go wrong?
There will be no Eve for Adam
If your apples have gone, gone, gone, gone
I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when the deeds are left to purchase

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins

Cypher is filled
With a blanket of clots
Taking everything I've got
Please let me in, in, in, in
I need a brand new skin
Incarnated debts
Incarcerated when the deeds are left to purchase

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins

Follow me tonight
Follow me into oblivion
Follow me tonight
Follow me into oblivion

If you could see where I've been
You'd touch the hand that's touching sin
Entity ingredient
A mass of blackened scapes begins
I seem to hide in metal plates
Held together alone don't wait
Hide with me identity
Until we've passed due date

Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Can't spot through the lens
Bleeding through your sanctuary
Intention accident
Bleeding through your sanctuary

Came back to doubt yourself but broke in two
They find it punctual with idle tooth
I'll find something to shake by the roots

I crawl along the ceilings in your room
The cold is spinning thread to answer you
I need something made of freewill

[Chorus:]
Am I waiting now?
Does my waiting howl?
Am I waiting now?
Does my waiting howl?
[x2]

I bring an avalanche of toltec bones
Contaminated cravings if you choose
To play something that aches for a spill
Leave out the meat for that contact high
Inhale the vapors and let the hangman smile
For that something to shake by roots

[Chorus]

Bring me the tame
Witness germinates in the child
That word of mouth stutters
Blink at the lonely dice
[x2]

Don't know

That night I remember what you slipped in my glass
We came rewinding when
I foamed at the mouth while the lights winked at me
And now my shape is kept
The rain it can't hide, wash the pain from this hex
Is it so permanent?
Did she catch a left eye when it blinks three times
Or once just to seal you in?
In your drunken breath did it stain like us
In place of poison heat?
I gotta rid this world of your intention
Swap the corpse in the casket

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Does he make you feel alright?

When I seep inside your truth through suspicious little coughs
You sank your nails inside a key while the door you shut closed up
The black stockings you kept smell of wet cigarette
Torn of lust that you could not keep
I have slept inside your fault to have you keep me here on this leash
For the rest of your pets I will feed to this theft
As we consummate the vows of defeat
And when you pray for an end to this I do believe this is eternity

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Your closet is bulging
White marrow withholding
Does he make you feel alright?

Give me that corpse please
The one that tore nightly
I really want it now
Fold the arms slowly
Don't want you to hold me
It fits just like a glove
Your closet is bulging
White marrow withholding
Does he make you feel alright?

Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Watch me now

Say it, say it, say it loud
Say it, say it, say it loud
Hold your heavy burden
In a pocket full of drink that I have drunk
Spit the remnants in your direction
This is the closest to any kingdom that you will come

I'm starting to feel a miscarriage coming on
It's numbing a stump clearing in my throat
And I just can't lose grip of it
She fumigated my mental hygiene
I'm all out of pulse but I know you can resuscitate me

Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before

Never heard a man speak like this man before
Never heard a man speak like this man before
All the days of my life ever since I've been born
Never heard a man speak like this man before
Watch me now

I've seen the only living traces flicker in the sulphur
And the ones who do believe me place your favor
Before you lay your question down there's a matter of the payment
To you I slipped on crooked sores in conclaves that you bothered

Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor
Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor
When I hear your fingers, they will spell my name
As I trade the faces of the holders

Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor
Let me be your Tourniquet Man
Let me keep you as a favor

I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
So much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
So much we can lose
I can't diminish anymore if I choose to dissolve in you
So much we can lose

A salty ring of night fatigue
When I get get get the sweats from you listening
Primordial cymatics giving birth into reverse
Serated mure ephemera undo her mother's curse

So if you break
Break me a mirror
Hang the broken pieces of a place that isn't here
Don't hide that guilty smile
Condolences won't go away

The coins you bring left footprints
Blind thirst and braille liquor
My bed is stained with fractures year after vitiated year
Four corners you are touching
They will liberate my need
Bite marks in the menagerie with infidelic teeth

So if you break
Break me a mirror
Hang the broken pieces of a place that isn't here
Don't hide that guilty smile
Condolences won't go away

Is there something out there
Waiting to take hold?
When that whore won't answer
Who is in control?
And the names you planted
Drop the seed into a hole

And the names you planted
Drop the seed into a hole
If you force me often
I might jump off the board

[Chorus:]
I am a deaf con angora goats
Warning you all who pass this mote
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic
Is this your first time at my conventicle?
You better not talk if you came here for semantics
It's only a matter of folding time and space
Before I become your epidemic

Don't ignore my presence
Hidden reads the scroll
By the time I asked her
The earth fell off the tongue
What once was laughter
Corrosive I became

What once was laughter
Corrosive I became
Where a scarlet bruise grows
Sprout the fault we own

[Chorus]

Don't hide your guilty fright
Condolences won't go away
You've got that guilty smile that culminates in Bedlam
[x4]

[Chorus]

I shoulda known you'd always scratch that itch
When you asked me for safe passage on my shoulders where we slid
And just before you laid dead weight upon its shores
I stung you in the face for that's the nature of my core
Because I got distance, don't let it close
Gotta let me know, you've just gotta let me know
Because forget which way is out now
Gotta let me know, you've just gotta let me know

[Chorus:]
I'm nowhere near this place you wear
It's unforgivable, it knows that I am visible
I'm broken mirrors and useless prayer
This lock is healing me, ya know you came so willingly

Waiting is a vessel that will take me to
Love it knows no order when you taste the truth
Because I'm trapped in this cement husk
Gotta let me go, you've just gotta let me go
Because I paid with my own touch now
I brought a little cut, there is blood for every month
In the way you used to call her wicked answers
Time is a plague, there's no time in this place
If ya don't, if you don't let me go
Heaven's made a cesspool of us all

[Chorus]

There burns a kiss with serpent scales
There is no miracle
I lost your miracle

I'm nowhere near this place you wear
It's unforgivable, it knows that I am visible
I'm...

I wrap myself around your buried question
Through the blisters of confinement
I seek to drain this broken shelter
To refill the pigment case that I have left

Don't stay long for teeth nurse the first wound
Coats revolve, hope to gain
What if we find what tongue ties double windsor?
Invoke to no reply
Those that lie have froze at the border
No implies close the frame
What if we find the sunlight draws a curtain?
Invoke to no reply

There's a place where this depth charge ignites
In this place where the soul has no purpose
I can't believe you when your thirst won't let me go
I am the moment you were always speaking of because there's...

No fence will hold the sentient
Culprit fall about it
Say when I can enter them
Culprit fall about it
One fell, the other taste won't lie
Make no doubt about it

How many blame, how many cave into the pressure I apply?
[x5 to fade]

I'll be there waiting with a hook in your neck
Is the contact you've made deficient?
And your hand will break if you touch this fence
Please them 'til they're blind with cleft lens

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?

I'll never perish with the albino horns of a thousand young born
Will you drink from the depths of my sea?
And your hand will break if you touch this fence
Please them 'til they're blind with cleft lens

What have you brought for my appetite?
What have you brought for my appetite?

I might not make it back again
The vervain is on the rise
Maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe
They've got to open wide
Got to open wide
Might of a serpent swallowing tail
Cycle recycled and I'm next to nothing

Help me come alive
[x4]

Place your ring finger on this debt
Am I living or am I dead?
Do what thou will tell them what I've found
The steps of a ladder from a diamondback's mouth

Help me come alive
[x6]

I ain't gonna hold my breath

It appears to me
Quoting alarms
The guillotine smirks
In your house I smothered
Sight unseen
Sworn to harm
Ground to a powder
And soaked through the board

[Chorus 1]
Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy
Don't you ever, ever, ever trust my mercy
When will you flirt with all that's burning?
Keep them safe and by your side

Of all that's left
A lucid home
Anecdote settles in the smear of this corpse
If the larvae speaks ask where to go
They mount the maker with a sulphur in fume

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Of all the warnings that you gave me
With all components in the fault
Have you ever heard me scraping?
It will be hard to hold

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]

All I hear
Mending the gap
Fall in here
Might not make it back
Call that someone
May they hear you
Take me with you
It's not safe in here

And all you ask is why, why, why
And all you ask is why I'm certain you're holding on
Mirror floats to the surface
Holding on

[Chorus 2]
[x2]

They lost the presence they were holding
Looks like the tenants flickered off
If the cell that holds me breaks me
It will be hard to hold

My love becomes a mange dyeing autumn in its leaves
When it broke me in the branch where my antlers come to feed
And I swam a hundred days in the bosom of this filth
Carry on this drought as I tighten this belt

[Chorus:]
This deceit has no arms
Bended will take what's yours
This deceit has no arms
Bended will take what's yours
Calling me
She's calling me
This it may have come to falter
We have become these pleads

In a field of balding marble where the medicine awaits
The hourglass pokes at the ribs of my cage
At half rations I'm finished
At half rations the minutes
All that happens was given
Coil and embrace

[Chorus]
[x2]

The horsemen you have brought deserve me
Some how they've made it through the floor
The clocks you set are they reversing
Before this visit turns conjugal
Ever more maybe tonight

So my half is waiting
Filed to a pulp
Used insomnia's been cleansing with floods
I got a pain inside that'll rip through the very fabric of time
Cause I've been with you before
God gave me sin
I've got to get born
Just so you know
There's too many reasons

Too many reasons
[x4]

You set the silver down to guard me from the weak
You check the spelling for nothing, nothing
You set the silver down to guard me from the weak
You check the spelling for nothing, nothing
You sent yourself the flood

[Chorus:]
All of this time
Bedsore containment
Where am I now that the music has faded?
[x2]

And I'm nowhere near the place
You sent me here to breathe
But I'm drawing closer to the present
And I'll find a space with no memories
I've got a second chance to inhabit the living

If Goliath won't speak I'm blinded by heaven
When will your Eden come die?
If the liars that blink are bound by the sender
Trinkets you gave have all rusted down

[Chorus]

You better steal this chance to give birth to more
You'll wear those healing damns down to the plug

[Chorus]

You better steal this chance to give birth to more
You'll wear those healing damns down to the plug

You yell out in defiance
You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns and
It makes you feel real small

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles
Broken glass
But it all ends up with handcuffs on your hands

You run around and spray paint
Graffiti on everybody's wall
You think that's bitchin man
That ain't nothing at all!

So you can cuss, spit, throw bottles
Broken glass
But it ends up with a swift kick to your ass

You yell out in defiance
You're backed up against the wall
They're up there clutching their guns and
It makes you feel real small

Cuss, spit, throw bottles
Broken glass
But it ends up with handcuffs on your hands

Do you remember how you wore that dress?
It slit my sight beneath the eyelids
Do you remember what you said to me?
What course has given you the right to stray?

And in your living tomb I'm stuck but safe
The clocks are ticking fast with every breath

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

But my heart, it asks just one more time
Are you still a mess?

One day a rain will come to wash away
The earth that held us was no island
I have become ingrown inside this skin
I'll find a way out through those eyelids

And all the days become a cast away
I seem to think I don't belong here

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
you will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

But my heart, it asks just one more time
Are you still a mess?

I don't belong here, I shouldn't stay
What falls inside me grows empty
The walls between us will never break
Just seal it shut, it grows empty

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
you will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

Since we've been wrong
I've been part awake
Since we've been wrong
You will never, ever know me
What took you so long?
I'm not sure all the way

But my heart, it asks just one more time
Are you still a mess?

Just don't know the layman's terms
to call the mess you bleed
Crawls beneath the surface
sought blood through a family tree

The date's been changed
with each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises?
These switches won't come on
What do I do to lose it?
Beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with a body inside
[x2]

Frames of infrared
keep scrolling into focus
Scarab claimed the busy signal
with the habits that you noticed

The date's been changed
with each new phase
I'm anxious bouts of nervous

What am I without the bruises?
These switches won't come on
What do I do to lose it?
Beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with a body inside
[x2]

Take in all the hostages
into the Oval Office
Draw the curtains, part their hair
and pull the trigger softly

If they have become empty
then I'll just take you with me
One driver in your motorcade
is all it takes, is all it takes

Selling graves in teflon veins
is all it takes is all it takes

What am I without the bruises?
These switches won't come on
What do I do to lose it?
Beneath this distress call

Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn
Stack the tires to the neck with a body inside
[x2]

When the earth let you go
when the verdict is vermin
By the fork in my tongue
when you run out of sermon

When sooner or later
is still not enough
What a foul little temptress
your daughter's become

Deviate all by means in name
cause we all crawl in quicksand the same
[x2]

The night I begged you to come to me
the limp in your talk and the scent of your bleed
It's still not enough roulette to let you go

You covered your wounds in a bandage of sloth
the deeper the slur that rang from her laugh
If something tells me to keep it together

How could you turn your back on me?
I've summoned the stampede of infidel feet
For all I ever wanted is all you ever flaunted

Deviate by all means in name
cause we all crawl in quicksand the same
[x2]

Vanish a fifth dementia
tables of ringworms have hung themselves
Disarray...
Communion shaped...

Serpents raise in prisms til rainbows escape

They sent in the necrophiliacs
Carcinogen tartans that smolder in asp
Disarray...
Communion shaped...

Serpents raise in prisms til rainbows escape

Reading from bottomless palindromes
hear my request to be disowned
Disarray...
Communion shaped...

Serpents raise in prisms til rainbows escape

Deviate by all means in name
cause we all crawl in quicksand the same
[x2]

I'm bolted from within
from long conniving heights
The hale, it makes a special sound
that always stays into the night

She tells me I'm not capable
of what they accuse me
With no remorse I stand and say
that guilt is what I plead

My devil makes me dream
like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner

The only way to see him
in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors
numb below the neck

In my heart

Where he keeps them in
a vault of devil daughters

When I bend and kick in form
with twilight as my guide
In every home the ghost pays gossip
you can hear them if you try

When my quill begins to squirm
from the ashes in your urn
Your deviance is anything but faithful

My devil makes me dream
like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner

The only way to see him
in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors
numb below the neck

In my heart

Where he keeps them in
a vault of devil daughters

Everybody
in my dead leaves
Don't you hide these
branches waiting

I've been watching
you four, two me
Don't resign me
I'm not waiting

My devil makes me dream
like no other mortal dreams
With a blank eye corner

The only way to see him
in the tunnel where he slept
By the longest tusk of corridors
numb below the neck

In my heart

Where he keeps them in
a vault of devil daughters

When sanskrit was my mother tongue
Scarabs filled my pillow
Tarmac strips to pave for them
And thrones from which to teach
And in that pulse the future said
The story had been spun
You wet your bed so sleep in it
Cards can't make a house

And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole...

When light years came
And light years passed
Tugging on the brink
Spoils reported missing
Put down in its sleep
Strangled in the background
Fitted for a mask
The future won't believe you
Past the ransom fast

And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
We'll be lucky if we eat tonight
And up that hill go the last of my crumbs
That's why I'll magnify a hole...

Don't beat around the pulpit
There is no lost and found
Where is the devil waiting
Trying to disguise...
I've seen what you used to look like
But down here you won't survive

I've got the weight of half of the world
Don't stop dragging the lake
I won't come home
If you can't come home
Even if you make a grave with my name
You better keep on looking for me

With qualms that I speak
of the wrists I have cut
By flooding the tubs
where the warmth held below

The lockets believe
that the secret of love
Has caught its own tail
and it just won't give up

When I breathe
the heavens can't hold me
And I can't believe anymore

The light breathes
the highest execution
Show me the wings I must cut

In your left of days
these are desperate graves

Give me the alter
let me shine
The pendulum won't wait
[x2]

If I slay your spirits
with twin covent vaults
That weakened your knees
in the pit of my palms

Dressed in the slurs
of bovine engines
To feast upon the carcass
of your mother

When I breathe
the heavens can't hold me
And I can't believe anymore

The light breathes
the highest execution
Show me the wings I must cut

In your left of days
these are desperate graves

Give me the alter
let me shine
The pendulum won't wait
[x2]

When I turn the dial
and leave the gas on
I'm the matchstick
that you'll never lose

These are the splinters
made from a single blade
I'm the matchstick
that you'll never lose

I'm like the key
that locks you in
I'm the matchstick
that you'll never lose

When you wear the burning
of all my ferns
I'm the matchstick
that you'll never lose

In your left of days
these are desperate graves

Give me the alter
let me shine
The pendulum won't wait
[x4]

Close the doors...
if you want to seen her breathing again
Blur the days...
sleeping is just not an option

How come every time I walk, you crawl?
Then you cut out all the letters that make up this note

I won't, I won't give up until I find out
until I find what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
holds a maximum vacancy
As I held you in crippled bandages
don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind...

You're not there...
I poke needles in the neck of a doll
She pokes back...
asking why can't I just let her lie

How come every time I walk, you crawl?
Then you cut out all the letters that make up this note

I won't, I won't give up until I find out
until I find what happened to you

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you in crippled bandages
don't you stay up and wait for me

Left dangling in the wind...

Don't let the days escape
what I did brings more of them
And we'll be waiting just for them

Over my dead body
over the search they lead
They won't find them anymore
[x2]

The solution inhaled from the rag I hold
holds a maximum vacancy
As I hold you in crippled bandages
don't you stay up and wait for me
[x2]

Left dangling in the wind...

How much do you make
in that death factory
Severance hold in the chamber of revolvers

Empty jails fall from my scalp
shaped the glove and let me out
Still I can remember the day
that they took you from me

Seems like I've been running
from your trenchant memory
Harpsichord will warn me when its over

Cause if heaven breathes
then someone trade places with me
Cause I don't want to tar feathers instead of rags

Instead of rags

When do I get to see the body preserved inside this brim
sewn on the lips were her last words
I'll be damned I can still hear her laughing

Your angels have tangled their breasts again (lol)
the comfort of doubt, still it keeps you thin
And still I can remember the day that they took you from me

Seems like I've been running
from your trenchant memory
Harpsichord will warn me when its over

Cause if heaven breathes
then someone trade places with me
Cause I don't want to tar feathers instead of rags

Instead of rags

Does your temperature ache?
Is your glass about to break?
Are you purple with currant?
Will you now become the serpent?

Gordian knots in the powerlines
sizes fill empty with pesticide
With a pharaoh to hold
bury me in gold

Will your sun refuse to bite
in the Stockholm city that we provide
If your heart does cease to speak
my fingernail claw will make your chalkboard sing

When you leave the lights on
contagions bind your doublespeak

Malice tends to choke my father's grip
but his hands are always clean

Walk towards the light
Convalesce, your fetish in me

You make me older
swatting flies in the vaseline

And I'm not getting any better
in this plot of dormant wakes

thorns decipher speak serrated
from the figure of an eight

That's when I disconnect from you
That's when I disconnect from you

That's when I disconnect from you
That's when I disconnect

No turning back now
too many shovels past the rubicon

Must I desecrate it?
Why can't you tell me where you've gone?

Christened to die
paranoia has hoax and device

Just when I find out
Moira draws the moth to fire

When the moon has burned the spirits
across the stem of higher self

You will hardly ever hear it
because the moon will always fail

That's when I disconnect from you
That's when I disconnect from you

That's when I disconnect from you
That's when I disconnect

I am a landmine, I am a landmine
so don't just step on me, so don't just step on me

Cause I'm a landmine, cause I'm a landmine
and I can blossom in the petals of an ECT

That's when I disconnect from you
That's when I disconnect, disconnect from

That's when I disconnect from you
That's when I disconnect, disconnect from

The days are catching up to me
my unconscious fear unbound
Is it time to tailor fit the notion
that come Sunday I'm in the ground?

The obelisk fumes have occupied
emphatically austere
a smelter pile made by the debt collector
where the children should be seen, not heard

Even if there is no way back home

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away

Can you hear him saber rattling
with bones I've left behind?
Obloquy is the bulwark of his implants
am I your son or just a clone?

Dasehra, you were sworn to be
a window to my night
my subterfuge, just branches to the mandrake
where the children should be seen, not heard

Even if there is no way back home

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away

Under the aegis of cognition
I am dead, I will escape

Engrammic marks of ligature
I am dead, I will escape

Under the aegis of cognition
I am dead, I will escape

Engrammic marks of ligature
am I dead, will I escape?

I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away
I'm not running away

Nature red in tooth and claw
I haven't seemed to keep my powder dry
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

The second that I fell in love
with the handle of your revolver
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

I begged to you a second chance
with dried white roads to Bethlehem
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

Am I the valency that you deny?

In the time of the sixth sun
we are cattle to the prod
and I burn this dictionary
because its my dyslexicon

When I collapse and bury all the things unconsciously I hear
cackling in chloroform this spectre will ensnare
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

A braided strand of children's manes
acquired with impunity
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

The things you say to me
are deaf in tongue
I always seem to hear it in your laughter

Am I the valency that you deny?

In the time of the sixth sun
we are cattle to the prod
and I burn this dictionary
because its my dyslexicon

You've never tasted heaven
stood the mother filled with grief
in the wake of Monday morning
finds the seventh day

If fate is your endearment
through pistil and through stem
in the wake of Monday morning
finds the seventh day

And on the seventh day
you will come to find
my prism is not colorblind
in death's mosaic spirit
finds the seventh day

That's why I repent
that's why I go under
that's why I repent for the night

In the time of the sixth sun
we are cattle to the prod
and I burn this dictionary
because its my dyslexicon

If I trust in the wind she will pave me a different road
I will try and start over but I think I must choose someone else
I am pulled from the pages where the letters lack the pigment of trust

Must be on my way, I’ve got to get home
Won’t be back someday, so let it unfold

I’ve abandoned the outcome in search of the rest I deserve
You can do what you will with my body but I won’t ring the bell
I’ve omitted the chapters that bow and admit defeat

Must be on my way, I’ve got to get home
Won’t be back someday, so let it unfold

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Of the flowers that grew from the cracks in the ground you paved
Didn’t you think he would warn me through the thorns of my waking dreams
When the riddles connected the dots of this constellation

Must be on my way, I’ve got to get home
Won’t be back someday, so let it unfold

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

I found a reason to leave you with this love
All I can do is forgive your broken heart
Trapped in this town made of amber for too long
All I can do is forgive your broken heart

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

Higher than mountains
Of cavernous people
Searching for a lighthouse in the fog

I must have crawled through your bedroom door
in a fit of jealous breath
perched upon the Bacchus foot
of your unsuspecting bed

From the blossom rags in my jackal croon
to the stems of this cinquefoil
I give to you the shrapnel
with which to sprinkle in the soil

Because...

All the traps in the cellar go clickety clack
cause you know I always set them for you

Yeah, for you!

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
yeah, you know they're gonna take me to you

Yeah, to you!

Wash it down with harlot soap
well, is this what you want?
I'll paint your steps with the lilac stains
of smelter revenant

My cutlery is rattling
in the dormant wooden drawers
from the palm of my throne I beckon you
to cut the orchid cord

Because...

All the traps in the cellar go clickety clack
cause you know I always set them for you

Yeah, for you!

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
yeah, you know they're gonna take me to you

Yeah, to you!

I know a girl that was woven
in spindle and thread
wrapped in a bivouac of taffeta
scaffolding wed

She tosses and turns
and wakes all the children in bed
yawning with hunger
they take turns of nourishment

She says...

Somebody, somebody help me
Is there anybody that can set me free?

From the mountains of avarice this I beg to you
My ether turns flesh to gravel

And all the traps in the cellar go clickety clack
cause you know I always set them for you

Yeah, I set them for you!

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
cause you know they're gonna take me to you

Yeah, to you!

And all the traps in the cellar go clickety clack
cause you know I always set them for you

Yeah, for you!

And all the rats in the cellar form a vermin of steps
yeah, you know they're gonna...

How long must I wait
How long must I wait
Til the mountains of avarice turn blue?

How long must I wait
How long must I wait
Til the moleskin I pick becomes fused?

The avulsion whims its spurs in the pinches of my earth
The dust I kick of animus shatters

Recorded on my reels of tape, the trauma stops my flow
and in your suppression tastes sulfur

Hear the children say
(Inexpressible innocence)

How long must I wait
How long must I wait
Til the mountains of avarice turn blue?

How long must I wait
How long must I wait
Til the moleskin I pick becomes fused?

As suddenly your avalanche
reverses my polarity

And secretly come Sunday morning
standing at the pulpit to an empty room

Hear the children say
(Inexpressible innocence)

Tear of mended sails

How long must I wait
How long must I wait
Til the mountains of avarice turn blue

How long must I wait
How long must I wait
Til the moleskin I pick becomes fused?

The drowning water you drink, passed on by birth
I’m no longer willing to give you control

There was once a boy
With knives stuck in his voice
All he wanted, all he wanted was a little affection

Until one day he came
To tempt his mother’s taste
All she wanted, all she wanted was to spread her infection

Spit and spindle we refuse
Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend
Her broken thoughts

They’ve stolen all my love
Buried in absentia

Can you hear my vitreous heart
Breaking in absentia

Smokestacks burn
I won’t turn
I won’t ever let you go

They’ve stolen all my love
Yes, they’ve stolen all my love

He returns alone
Changes here nor there

Does he want some
Does he want a little insurrection?

Withhold my regrets
Insomnatic fate

Opt out of incision
Tear down the reason
I’ve just gotta get out of here

Spit and spindle we refuse
Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend
Her restless limbs

They’ve stolen all my love
Buried in absentia

Can you hear my vitreous heart
Breaking in absentia

Smokestacks burn
I won’t turn
I won’t ever let you go

They’ve stolen all my love
Yes, they’ve stolen all my love

Taken by the night
Dye the gates remembrance

Check the puzzle, does it fit
I am alpha and omega

And on the seventh day I rise
Past the pangs of my resistance

When the son gives up his throne
What becomes of this theft

Dasehra, make these shackles go away
Dasehra, make these shackles go away

Dasehra, won’t you help me stand my ground if I should fall

Dasehra, as long as I am injured
Dasehra, as long as I remember

Dasehra, as long as I am injured
Dasehra, as long as I remember

My anguish told you
A persistent lie

The parasitic psychics that you push by wheel
Were spoken to me everytime

And like a charlatan
You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time

These pacts we keep in secret
Drinking from a well that was cured by drought

My torment adores you
When my strings are tied

Out of compulsion I must decimate
The sapless embryonic miles

And like a charlatan
You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time

These pacts we keep in secret
Drinking from a well that was cured by drought

My knives are burrowed voices
Glistened by the handles so they won't let go

These limbs are out of reaches
Extensions of a spirit that is not controlled

My heart is trapped inside
And I refuse to accept this throne

My night's unfolding
Reads like a page of test results

This sterile codex
Is missing all my last resolve

And like a charlatan
You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time

These pacts we keep in secret
Drinking from a well that was cured by drought

The world is burned, it never hurts
shanks round the bend when you're foaming at the binge

On your serrated edge, you're like a snail that sticks
The hiss I make is warning to the scoundrel

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When the body wants to fix this frame
the guilty presence starts to villicate

Fall into the strangle, skip around the neck
this albatross is warning with extreme prejudice

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

When you walk the plank, tell me what you see
Moloch in the time of mutiny

Half of the time
I'm never clean

Filth of my filth
can't get no relief

Half of the time
I see the weak

Don't roll your eyes
and still you can't see

All of my coins
you've taken and gave

Filled 'til you're bawling
and still you're empty

What's that satchel of numbers doing?
Can't my fingers tell extinction?

By the landfill I rest
I burn their clothing before I dig into the ground
I am Janus-faced denial with vines
you're gonna wish you hadn't run

Clarity is calling me
I hear the hums of tiny beating drums
I feigned umbrage at my bruising fist
you're gonna wish you hadn't run

And with these trinkets pale of moon
senescent charms become a bludgeon of wrinkles
when I nurse your tired heart

For every time you hear the strain
of lullabies collapsing
walk towards the echo and let it hold you trembling

Their gourds are punctured easily
amnesia fumes in little twists of silk
induce this multistrobe with melody
you're gonna wish you hadn't run

I sing here at the seedy urn
my father taught me when I was young
you wear the tattered fringe of hangnail regalia
you're gonna wish you hadn't run

And with these trinkets pale of moon
senescent charms become a bludgeon of wrinkles
when I nurse your tired heart

For every time you hear the strain
of lullabies collapsing
walk towards the echo and let it hold you trembling

Here it comes again
Mesh of arms travels up my neck

Morning dawn declares itself
And mirrors stare back at my reflection

When I’m alone, I’m alone at night
I want winter to fall on me

And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
I am free of equity

Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that I’m under

A kindred connivance
I’m ripped and in ruins

Here it comes again
Malady of Veda in your ears

Flood the droughts that those...
I can’t stop myself because

When I'm alone, I’m alone at night
I will set my father free

And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key

Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over

A kindred connivance
I’m ripped and in ruins

Long way patience to drown
With friends that you won’t save for me

Long way patience to drown
Spin through my spiral, I danced with delay

Long way patience to drown
You call me, I answer and all I can do is obey

Long way patience to drown
I can’t hold my breath for this long

When I’m alone, I’m alone at night
I wanna set my father free

And I’m alone, I’m alone in flight
My mother holds the lock and key

Where did I go wrong?
I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over

I won’t let you, I won’t let them
Set me to repeat

Make my bed in droughts of beryl
I haven't shot this thing in years
Do you think I'll fold?

Calloused hands of detriment
From a crossbow flinch of gasping air
Do you think I'll...

So long, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden

Sewn along your hollow heart
We'll never hassle you

Remember at the hips where we once joined
Severed by the scalpel when we were young
Do you think I'll fold?

Held under the water in a blacklist trough
Buried in the plots of your front steps
Do you think I'll fold?

Incinerate the faith that you were taught
Incinerate your crown of useless flesh
Do you think I'll...

So long, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden

Sewn along your hollow heart
We'll never hassle you

And if this life belonged to me
you can stop the rain from falling

Tie it on in your mind
Its your noctourniquet

And in your fight to live and breathe
Then you keep it to the night

Tie it on in your mind
Its your noctourniquet

Made my bed in droughts of beryl
I haven't shot this thing in years
Do you think I'll fold?

Your color seems to flower from your hissing tongue
Your livery of siblings cut from saffron cloth
Do you think I'll fold?

I'll reach out through the pavement with the shortest straw
Lavera, don't play in your mother's drawer
Do you think I'll fold?

Come hasten to the first drop of endless flasks
Heretics and peasants with a quench forboding
Do you think I'll...

So long, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden

Sewn along your hollow heart
We'll never hassle you

So long, don't fall apart
The words have made a perfect burden

Sewn along your hollow heart
Whatever one takes, whatever one takes for you

I'm not breathing any better
Mallets crack with every grin

I hear the scraping plea of branches
Against my broken window

I won't let you in

The silhouette holds me under
Can't poke me with these pins

Flotsam drip of nectar
Nexus bean sprouting

When she says

Saint Christopher
Don't go wandering

With noone left to save
Cause noone's at the wheel

Saint Christopher

Antidote claps with thunder
From a gash of staple rain

This bed will never rest you
The answers in the sermons

I won't let you in

The stoking fits the crowning
A wasted gust of kin

Repulsion turns to nectar
When the pigment leaves the body

When she says

Saint Christopher
Don't go wandering

With noone left to save
Cause noone's at the wheel

Saint Christopher

Lastborn prey and firstborn caught
Crawling like an animal

Hold your breath its feeding time
In this zed and two naughts

Painted a fulcrum of caves
Piled with dreams of

Phantom masses made of pastures
Labyrinths turning, cystic maze

I've been hanging wreaths of cancer
On every door where children sing

Watch it all blister

Saint Christopher
Don't go wandering

With noone left to save
Cause noone's at the wheel

Saint Christopher
